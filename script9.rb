# In working with scope, the following applies: 
#   $ is for global variables, 
#   @ is for instance variables
#   @@ is for class variables
#
# Global variables can be declared in two ways: 
# 1. Use the @ to define the variable outside of any method or class, and voilÃ ! It's global. 
# 2. If you want to make a variable global from inside a method or class, just start it with a $, like so: $matz.

#This is a time saver when you're writing something very short, like an empty class or method definition.
