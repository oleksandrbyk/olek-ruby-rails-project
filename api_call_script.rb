The number of HTTP methods you'll use is quite smallâ€”there are just four HTTP "verbs" you'll need to know! They are:

-- The GPPD --
GET: retrieves information from the specified source.
POST: sends new information to the specified source.
PUT: updates existing information of the specified source.
DELETE: removes existing information from the specified source.

An HTTP request is made up of three parts:

The request line, which tells the server what kind of request is being sent (GET, POST, etc.) and what resource it's looking for;
The header, which sends the server additional information (such as which client is making the request)
The body, which can be empty (as in a GET request) or contain data (if you're POSTing or PUTing information, that information is contained here).
